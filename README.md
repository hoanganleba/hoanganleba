## 🧭 About Me

I'm a Quant Researcher working at the intersection of **mathematics, machine learning, and financial markets**.  
My work focuses on designing systematic trading strategies and building research frameworks grounded in first principles.

I focus heavily on **developing algorithms and models from scratch**, avoiding unnecessary abstractions, and favoring full control over data pipelines, simulation logic, and signal mechanics.

## 🧰 Technical Focus

### Quant & Research Principles
- Alpha signal research (cross-sectional & time-series)  
- Factor modeling & statistical foundations  
- Risk modeling and portfolio construction  
- Backtesting frameworks built from first principles  

### Tools & Core Stack
My workflow deliberately centers around **NumPy** and **Pandas** as the fundamental building blocks:

- **NumPy:** vectorized operations, custom factor engines, linear algebra  
- **Pandas:** time-series pipelines, data wrangling, feature engineering  

I minimize dependencies and avoid higher-level libraries like PyTorch or SciPy unless absolutely needed — ensuring **transparent, controllable, reproducible research**.
