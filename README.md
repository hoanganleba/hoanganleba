## 🧭 About Me

I'm a Quant Researcher working at the intersection of **mathematics, machine learning, and financial markets**.  
My work focuses on building systematic trading strategies and developing research frameworks that extract signals from noisy financial data.

I previously worked as a web developer, but transitioned fully into quantitative finance to pursue deeper analytical and modeling challenges.
